Description: Contains functions that allow Bayesian meta-analysis (1) with binomial data, counts(y) and total counts (n) or, (2) with user-supplied point estimates and associated variances.   Case (1) provides an analysis based on the logit transformation of the sample proportion. This methodology is also appropriate for combining data from sample surveys and related sources. The functions can  calculate the corresponding similarity matrix.
